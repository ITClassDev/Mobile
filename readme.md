# ShTP Mobile Client
[ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ English](/readme.md) [ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º Russian](/readme.ru.md)

## About
* This is an Android client developed as a REST API client for the [Back-End](https://github.com/ITClassDev/Backend) server.
* Connection to the server is made using compressed data exchange via the Protocol Buffers protocol, unlike the FrondEnd server, which is necessary to be always online even with a bad internet connection. (JSON can be easily switched to ProtoBuf)
* RxJava3 + Retrofit2 are used to exchange messages, which allows executing requests asynchronously.
* The user interface is based on the [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/k45gvSrwIiGPbaLBunFHw9/Android?node-id=160%3A174&t=RIWBJ2Qv6cmYgMKH-1)
